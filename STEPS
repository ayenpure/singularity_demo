# 1. Download and install basic dependencies

sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential \
                        libssl-dev \
                        uuid-dev \

                        squashfs-tools

# 2. Download and install Go
# The GOPATH environment variable is used to specify directories outside of 
# $GOROOT that contain the source for Go projects and their binaries.
# This tutorial does not need GOROOT.

wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.11.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.11.5.linux-amd64.tar.gz
echo 'export GOPATH=${HOME}/go' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:${PATH}:${GOPATH}/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# 3. Download, build, and install Singularity

mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/sylabs
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/sylabs
git clone https://github.com/sylabs/singularity.git
cd singularity
go get -u -v github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep

# Edit mconfig is you want to change the install prefix

./mconfig
make -C builddir
sudo make -C builddir install

# This concludes installation of Singularity
